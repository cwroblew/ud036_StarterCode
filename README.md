## Setting Up Movies

Movies are stored in the `entertainment_center.py` file in the format:

    * title
    * storyline
    * movie poster image URL (a good place to find these is on wikipedia)
    * trailer link from youTube
```
media.Movie("Toy Story",
            "A story of a boy and his toys that come to life",
            "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Toy_Story.jpg",
            "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwyZH85NQC4")
```

Each movie has it's own entry.

## Viewing the movie trailer page

The movie trailer page displays the movie poster image.
When hovering over a poster for a movie, the storyline will be displayed.
Clicking on the movie poster opens the trailer video on youTube.
